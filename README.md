### Key Takeaways

**Trends That Match Expectations**

* Mental Health Counseling Increase: The rise from ~10% to ~13% aligns with growing awareness, reduced stigma, and expanded telehealth services, particularly post-pandemic.
* Decline in Cigarette Smoking & Rise in E-Cigarette Use: This reflects national trends, as traditional smoking continues to decline while e-cigarettes gain traction, especially among younger populations.
* Increase in High Cholesterol, Obesity, and Chronic Pain: These conditions have been trending upward, driven by aging demographics, lifestyle factors, and better screening/diagnosis.
* Public Health Insurance Uptick & Uninsured Rate Decline: This matches policy shifts like expanded Medicaid access under the Affordable Care Act and post-pandemic healthcare coverage efforts.

**Notable & Interesting Findings**

* Higher Asthma Rates in Bisexual & AIAN/White Groups: While asthma disparities exist, this specific demographic combination isn’t something commonly seen highlighted. It could warrant further investigation into environmental or socioeconomic factors.
* Mental Health Disparities in Bisexual & Disabled Groups: The much higher counseling rates and cost-related barriers for bisexual individuals align with known disparities in LGBTQ+ health but highlight a critical access gap.
* Obesity Trends by Disability & Ethnicity: The higher prevalence in disabled individuals and lower prevalence among Asian-only individuals are consistent with known health patterns.
