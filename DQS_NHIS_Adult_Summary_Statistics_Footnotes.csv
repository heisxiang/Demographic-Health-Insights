NHISAdult,FN_NHISA15,Footnote,,"The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses U.S. Census Bureau data to determine the social vulnerability of every census tract.

SVI ranks each U.S. census tract on 15 social factors, which are then grouped into four related themes: socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial and ethnic minority status and language, and housing type and transportation. SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every census tract as a percentile ranking ranging from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability. The overall tract summary ranking variable for 2018 was used to categorize four quartiles of vulnerability: Scores from 0 to 0.2500 are categorized as ""little to no social vulnerability,"" 0.2501-0.500 are ""low social vulnerability,"" 0.5001-0.7500 are ""medium social vulnerability,"" and 0.7501-1.0 are ""high social vulnerability.""
